# Migration

As of 3/18/22, the website is migrated to Heroku. Due to errors with running PHP code (for the chat feature), Heroku has become a provider of this website. PHP files do not work with GitHub Pages, but seem to work well with Heroku. See https://oneenterprises-tech.herokuapp.com/ for the chat. Chats are not currently cached for very long (a couple of hours?)

This website is designed to provide help to others, allow users access to third-party resources (audio from Archive.org), and includes a plethora of amusing (and fun) resources such as games and cheats. It also provides guides and codes for TI calculator enthusiasts (mostly TI-83 or better calculators)
